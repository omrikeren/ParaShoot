# ParaShoot
A Hebrew question and answering dataset in the style of [SQuAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250), based on articles scraped from Wikipedia. The dataset contains a few thousand crowdsource-annotated pairs of questions and answers, in a setting suitable for few-shot learning.

For more details and quality analysis, see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11314).
